<b>Status:</b> Dropped-out <br>
<br>
Week 1 provided strong introduction about Android Internals. (5/5) <br>
Week 2 provided strong application fundamentals on Android. (5/5) <br>
Theoritically, it's good. But, i already know about it 5 years back itself. <br>
Then, some activity layouts were done. <br>
Then, suddenly intents and permissions. <br>
Then, monetization. <br>
I got confused. <br>
I want to understand well only like how i understand web stuffs... <br>
I wanted to feel the depth in my brain nerves... it failed.<br>
Not so curious to build any hi-fi apps and make money. <br>
I joined this course to bring back my lost skills in android. <br>
Building apps are fun, but as a stubborn curious learner, i don't feel satisfied at all. <br>
Anyways, there was Amazon offers and i resgistered. <br>
Mainly, my fingers weren't coding much during the course. <br>
<br>
It is a good course, but i didn't like it. <br>
